# API contracts

The regression bed that guarantees the mobile app's expectations of the read API
don't silently break. At Phase-6 cutover the installed app calls these endpoints,
so their JSON response **shapes** (keys, nesting, value types) must stay stable.

## What's here

- **`snapshots/*.json`** — one committed example response per read endpoint,
  produced from a known seeded database. Each file is a *representative* payload:
  the contract test asserts a live response has the **same nested key set and the
  same value types** (values themselves may differ run-to-run; a handful of
  deterministic derived numbers are asserted exactly in the test).

| Snapshot | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| `today.json` | `GET /api/today` |
| `sleep.json` | `GET /api/sleep` |
| `sleep_health_score.json` | `GET /api/sleep/health_score` |
| `sleep_consistency.json` | `GET /api/sleep/consistency` |
| `activity.json` | `GET /api/activity` |
| `workout.json` | `GET /api/activity/workout?start=…` |
| `history.json` | `GET /api/history?metric=…` |
| `history_batch.json` | `GET /api/history?metrics=a,b,c` |
| `profile.json` | `GET /api/profile` |
| `entitlement.json` | `GET /api/entitlement` |
| `log_recent.json` | `GET /api/log/recent` |
| `log_post.json` | `POST /api/log` |
| `gps_list.json` | `GET /api/workout/gps` |
| `map.json` | `GET /api/map` |
| `gps_detail.json` | `GET /api/workout/gps/{track_id}` |
| `challenges.json` | `GET /api/challenges` |
| `challenge_outcomes.json` | `GET /api/challenges/outcomes` |
| `challenge_adopt.json` | `POST /api/challenges/{id}/adopt` |
| `mirror_manifest.json` | `GET /api/mirror/manifest` (docs/MIRROR.md) |
| `mirror_month.json` | `GET /api/mirror/derived_daily?month=…` |

### `coach_stream_events.json` — `POST /api/coach/stream`, a different shape of contract

Every snapshot above is ONE JSON response. `/api/coach/stream` emits a SEQUENCE of
Server-Sent Events instead (`event: <name>\ndata: <one-line json>\n\n`), so this
snapshot is a list of `{"event": ..., "data": {...}}` samples — one of each event
KIND the wire contract defines (`stage`, `draft`, `answer`, `error`), not one whole
response. `stage` carries one representative `{"stage", "round", "detail"}` shape;
every stage NAME (`context`/`thinking`/`tool`/`checking`/`revising`) uses that same
shape, so one sample covers all five. `answer`'s `data` is exactly what
`POST /api/coach` itself returns (`insights.coach.coach_reply_payload`) — the two
endpoints share one function, so they cannot drift on this shape. `error`'s `data` is
the `{"status", "message"}` pair the streaming twin ships instead of an HTTP failure
once the response has begun.

`draft` is the owner's 2026-09-19 call (`docs/INTELLIGENCE.md` section 3): the
coach's answer prose, streamed AS A DRAFT while the model is still writing it, shown
muted in the app until the validated `answer` event supersedes it. Its `data` is
`{"round", "text"}` — `text` is the WHOLE draft so far, not a delta: the client
REPLACES its draft with each frame, never appends. It appears zero or more times per
answer round, always between that round's `thinking` and `checking` stage events, at
most once every 100ms, with one final flush carrying the round's last text. A
rewrite (a candidate rejected, then `revising`) starts a NEW round: its first `draft`
carries the new round number and starts from empty text — a `draft` for round *n*
never follows a `checking`/`revising` stage also carrying round *n*. The terminal
`answer` event always supersedes every `draft` that preceded it, whatever the drafts
said.

`apps/server/tests/contracts/test_coach_stream_contract.py` drives a scripted,
tool-using coach turn (the DB-backed context build stubbed, exactly as
`tests/insights/test_coach.py` does — this is a structural check on the wire format,
not a seeded-DB fixture test) and asserts the captured events conform to this file
with `shape.assert_conforms`, plus a second scripted run of the error path.

## The harness

Lives in `apps/server/tests/contracts/` (runs under `uv run pytest`):

- `seed.py` — seeds a deterministic v2 dataset into every table the read layer
  reads (profile, samples, sleep sessions + a nap, a workout, `derived_daily`
  rows with the flags the payloads read, manual entries + an open fast, an
  illness flag, a recommendation, a finding, a GPS track).
- `seed_challenges.py` — the WP-C2 slice: a suggested, an active and a
  completed challenge plus a fully-populated frozen outcome. Its own module
  because `seed.py` is at the 400-line gate, and because the ledger's
  `confounds` / `co_occurring` / `data_confidence` fields ARE the contract
  (CHALLENGES.md §7 decision 1) — a snapshot generated from nulls would let a
  client render a co-occurring delta with no concurrency count beside it.
- `endpoints.py` — the endpoint list + a helper that calls every one (resolving
  the two dynamic ids: a workout start and a GPS track id).
- `shape.py` — the structural conformance check (same keys + types; union/
  heterogeneous object-lists supported; numbers are `int`/`float`-interchangeable;
  nulls accepted on either side).
- `test_contracts.py` — asserts each live response conforms to its snapshot, plus
  exact deterministic derived values (strain, sleep-performance %, ACWR, VO2max).
- `test_perf.py` — bounds the `/api/today` query count (no N+1) + a latency check.

These tests are marked `integration` and auto-skip when no TimescaleDB is
reachable, so `pytest` stays green on a laptop with no database and exercises the
real DB in CI.

## Regenerating the snapshots

After an intentional, reviewed shape change, regenerate against a reachable DB:

```bash
cd apps/server
POSTGRES_HOST=… POSTGRES_PORT=… POSTGRES_DB=… POSTGRES_USER=… POSTGRES_PASSWORD=… \
  REALTIME_INGEST_TOKEN=contract-token \
  uv run python -m tests.contracts.generate
```

Review the diff — a snapshot change is a wire-contract change and must be a
deliberate, reviewed commit (the installed app depends on it).

### A shape change is not a date change

`generate.py` seeds from `now()`, so a full regeneration rewrites **every date in
every snapshot** — the payload dates, the trend points, the night list. That is
not a wire-contract change and it is not free: `apps/mobile`'s suite is
calibrated to these dates (`test/features/_today_host.dart`'s `todayDate`,
`_screen_data.dart`'s pinned `now`, and the golden test that reads `today.json`
straight out of this directory), so a regeneration run purely to add a key turned
273 mobile tests red while changing nothing about the contract.

So: regenerate to SEE the new shape, then apply that shape to the committed files
and leave their dates alone. The diff a reviewer should get for a new key is the
new key. Note also that the committed files carry literal `—` and `₂` where
`generate.py` writes `—` and `₂`, so a hand-applied edit wants
`ensure_ascii=False`.

**A new key can carry a date of its own**, and a merge that only copied values
across would then stamp the generating run's date inside a snapshot dated months
earlier — `metrics[].as_of_date` and a finding's `points[].date` are both like
this. Shift every date inside an added value by
`snapshot["date"] - fresh["date"]` so the file stays internally consistent; a
snapshot whose new key disagrees with its own payload date is a false record in
the file that is meant to *be* the contract.

**A CHANGED value is not a new key and no merge will find it.** Three of the
honesty-sweep edits were value changes — `anomalies` `[]` → `null`,
`naps[].stages` array → totals object, `weekly_mvpa_min` `null` → a number — and
each had to be applied deliberately. The shape test compares key sets and types
and accepts a null on either side, so it will not fail on a stale value: only
reading the diff catches these.
