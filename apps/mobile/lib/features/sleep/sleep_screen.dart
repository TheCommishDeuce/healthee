/// Sleep — the v02 prototype's screen, on this app's own three reads.
///
/// Composition only. `sleep_sections.dart` decides what the screen shows and in
/// what order; this file is the frame around it — the reads, their failure
/// rules, the reveal registry and the five destinations the screen can reach.
///
/// ## Its own screen, not the Today shell
///
/// `shared/instrument_screen.dart` is built on `/api/today` and this phone's
/// store. Sleep is built on `/api/sleep`, `/api/sleep/consistency` and
/// `/api/sleep/insight` — **three reads that fail independently**. That is not
/// an accident of the client: `data/sleep_repository.dart` gives each its own
/// provider and its own timeout, and the regularity block feeds one panel and
/// must never be able to take the measured half of the screen down with it.
/// Bending the shared shell around a second payload would have made every other
/// screen carry a source only this one uses.
///
/// ## Reveal-once, and why the registry lives here
///
/// `CLAUDE.md`: *"Scrollable chart screens use `ListView.builder` + reveal-once
/// animation, or charts replay on every scroll."* The builder destroys an item's
/// element when it leaves the viewport, so "have I animated?" cannot live in the
/// chart. It lives in this `State` and is handed to the panels, each of which
/// wraps its own chart in a `RevealOnce` keyed to a stable id.
///
/// A refresh is the one thing that may reset the registry — new data earns a
/// fresh reveal. Scrolling never does.
