/// `design/mobile-preview/sleep-history-view.js::H.screens.sleep`, read top to
/// bottom at 390 px with the prototype open in a browser:
///
/// ```text
///   header                     date · Sleep · avatar
///   .sleep-reading             time asleep, and the strap's own score
///   .colour-key                bedtime · wake · time in bed
///   How your night unfolded    the stage timeline and its legend
///   Every stage, accounted for the proportion strip, then the four totals
///   Your body overnight        five overnight measurements, each with a spark
///   Your four sleep checks     four readings, four cutoffs, no total
///   Sleep need & debt          the shortfall, and what it is a shortfall against
///   Your week, stage by stage  seven nights, stacked
///   Sleep timing               bedtime and wake, and the regularity around them
///   ══ Beyond a single night ══

/// ## What is on this screen that the prototype has no box for
///
/// Four things, and all four sit **after** every panel the prototype draws, so
/// its order is never interrupted:
///
/// - **Tonight** — `/api/sleep/consistency`'s lever.
/// - **Sleep analysis** — `/api/sleep/insight`'s grounded reading.
/// - **Findings** — `/api/sleep`'s own sleep-scoped correlations, drawn only
///   when the list is non-empty; a heading over an empty list is a section that
///   exists to say there is nothing in it.
///
/// The fourth is the **stale banner**, and it is the exception that sits near
/// the top: it says *everything below is from an older night*, and a sentence
/// like that is worth nothing under the thing it qualifies. That is the honesty
/// layer, which is the one place this rebuild has latitude.
///
/// ## What survived the redesign
///
/// The **data wiring**, whole. Three reads that fail independently, every figure
/// still a `Reading`, every refusal still rendered as a refusal with the
/// server's own reason, and the four sleep dimensions still four.
///
/// The eleven pre-v02 cards did not survive. Their measurements did: every one
/// of them is on a panel above, and the references and citations they drew on
/// their faces now open from the ⓘ, which is where the owner asked them to live.
