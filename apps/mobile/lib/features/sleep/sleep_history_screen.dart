///   Sleep duration          the month of nightly totals
///   Open a night            every night in the window, as a button

/// asked for the repeat out (R1, `DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`).
///
/// ## The rows set the day, and Sleep now opens on it
///
/// `H.actions['date-night']` calls `H.setViewDate(...)` and then navigates to
/// Sleep, which is what produces the prototype's `?date=…#sleep`. The app's
/// equivalent of `setViewDate` is `viewDateProvider`, and it is written here for
/// the same reason: the selection *follows the reader between screens*.
///
/// **The seam this file used to record is closed.** It said that a row landed
/// on Sleep with the day selected and Sleep still opened on its latest night,
/// because `SleepWindows` sliced from the front of `/api/sleep`'s newest-first
/// list. `SleepWindows.through` now ends the window on the chosen night, and
/// `core/routes.dart` carries the day in the route, so the row does what it
/// looks like it does.
///
/// This screen's own list ends there too: the month of nightly totals and the
/// `Open a night` rows both stop on the selected day, which is
/// `history-data.js::H.nightsThroughDay`'s rule.
