///
/// ## `naps[].stages` USED TO BE STRUCTURALLY EMPTY. IT NO LONGER IS.
///
/// `/api/sleep` shipped the raw hypnogram under the key a *night* uses for
/// per-stage minute totals, so the shape that reached the phone was empty on
/// every nap, on every day, for every owner. The pre-v02 card drew a stage bar
/// from it and rendered a strip with nothing in it; this panel drew no bar and
/// said in a sentence that the server did not send the breakdown.
///
/// The server sends it now (`docs/BACKEND_GAPS_FROM_UI.md` A1), so **that
/// sentence is gone — it had become false, which is worse than the gap it was
/// describing.**
///
/// **No bar came back with it, and that is not an oversight.** The prototype
/// (`design/mobile-preview/sleep-history-view.js`, quoted above) draws nap rows
/// as text and has no stage element on this panel at all. The old comment's
/// "when the server starts filling that field the bar can come back" was reading
/// the pre-v02 card as the specification; it is not. Adding one now would be a
/// design decision, and the design is the owner's.
///
/// What replaces the sentence is the honest half of it: [kNapsUnstagedNote] says
/// the *strap* recorded no stages, and only when that is true of every nap shown.
/// That is a fact about the recording rather than a complaint about the wire.
///
/// ## The rows are a TABLE, not the prototype's sentences
///
/// The prototype joins each nap into one middot-separated line, and sixteen of
/// those read as a paragraph: `6 Sep · 3:52 pm–4:58 pm · 1h 6m` eight times
/// over, with the day, the clock and the length landing at a different x on
/// every row because each one is a different number of characters wide. Nothing
/// can be compared down a column because there are no columns.
///
/// Three fixed columns instead — day, when, how long — so a reader scanning for
/// "which was the long one" reads one column instead of sixteen sentences. A
/// cell with nothing recorded draws the app's own [kNoReading], not a gap: a
/// blank cell in a table reads as a rendering fault, and dropping the field
/// (which the sentence did) silently reflowed the row.
