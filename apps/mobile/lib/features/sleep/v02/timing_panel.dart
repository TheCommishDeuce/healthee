/// `Sleep timing` — when the owner went to bed, and when they got up.

/// `design/mobile-preview/sleep-history-view.js`:

/// H.panel('Sleep timing','sleep',
///   `${rhythm(week)}${H.evidence('sleep_regularity_index','About regularity')}`,

/// ```
///
/// ## The owner asked for this chart by name
///
/// > *"the current has a graph for sleeptime vs wake time I would love to keep
/// > that graph along with all v2 sleep."*
///
/// So the plot inside this panel is the app's own [V02TimingChart] — two lines
/// on one 18:00-origin scale — rather than the prototype's `H.charts.consistency`,
/// which draws seven identical bars at fixed coordinates with no data behind
/// them. What was restyled and what was kept is recorded in that chart's own
/// docstring; the short version is that its geometry and its two series are
/// untouched and its chrome is now v02's.
///
/// ## What else is in the panel
///
/// `/api/sleep/consistency` — a **separate read that fails on its own** — carries
/// the typical onset band, the median bed and wake clocks, the nights that sit
/// outside the band and a server-authored action. All of it is drawn under the
/// chart when it arrives and none of it when it does not; the chart is the half
/// of this panel that comes from `/api/sleep` and never waits on the other read.
///
/// The SRI that block also carries is **not drawn here** (R5,
/// `DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`): the night's regularity check on this screen already
/// states it, and Insights carries its trend — three copies was the repeat the
/// owner reported.
