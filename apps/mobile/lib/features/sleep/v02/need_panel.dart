///
/// ## Two deliberate differences from the prototype's numbers
///
/// **`/api/sleep` now sends the need and the debt** — the same `sleep_debt`
/// block the Today page carries, from the same rows. It used to send neither,
/// and this panel measured its shortfall against `kSleepNeedMin`, a client
/// constant of 480 minutes flat. The server's need is age-selected (NSF 2015:
/// 480 under 65, 450 at 65 and over), so for an older owner the two tabs
/// reported different shortfalls for the same nights and neither said which was
/// which. That is the second definition `CLAUDE.md`'s first hard rule is about,
/// and the constant is deleted rather than corrected: a better client constant
/// is still a second definition.
///
/// **Where the server has no need, this panel says so and draws nothing.** The
/// need band is selected from AGE, so a profile with no date of birth has none
/// — and a shortfall, a performance percentage and a nightly gap are all
/// ratios against it. Withheld with the reason, never computed against an
/// assumed eight hours.
///
/// The shortfall is still summed over the nights THIS SCREEN was sent, not over
/// the server's fourteen, so the note under the chart names the count actually
/// used — *"the 7 measured nights of the last seven"*. A `14` here would be a
/// label borrowed from a model that is not running behind it; the server's own
/// 14-night debt is a different figure and lives on the Today page.
///
/// ## ⛔ TWO WINDOWS ON ONE CARD, AND THEY MUST SAY WHICH IS WHICH
///
/// The debt is summed over **the measured week** and the chart draws **those
/// seven nights**. `Sleep performance` and `Nightly gap` are **last night** —
/// `sleep_performance_pct` is `last_tst / need`, ported verbatim and cited to
/// `sleep_need_debt`, and the explainer says so in words.
///
/// Stacked unlabelled, that reads as one window. Worse, it reads as the RIGHT
/// one by coincidence: on the owner's own week the debt was `16h 04m` over 7
/// nights — a mean of `2h 18m` — directly above a `Nightly gap` of `2h 26m`.
/// Eight minutes apart, so the wrong reading is indistinguishable from the
/// average nobody computed. **Never let these two sit together unlabelled.**
///
/// The fix is the label, never the arithmetic: making performance weekly here
/// would be the second definition `CLAUDE.md`'s first hard rule forbids, and
/// the server owns this one.
///
/// ## The chart is `HDebtBars`, not a second one
///
/// `H.charts.sleepGap` draws each night's bar to what was slept and a dashed
/// ghost from there up to the reference. `HDebtBars` already draws exactly that,
/// takes no `Color`, takes its reveal as a parameter, and is the app's one
/// need-versus-actual chart. A second painter would be a second opinion about
/// the same seven nights.
