/// Settings — v02's index of rows, each opening a screen of its own.
///
/// ## What changed, and what did not
///
/// **Not one row's behaviour.** Every setting this screen used to hold inline —
/// the appearance segmented button, the two expanding preference cards, the
/// server card, the strap card, the diagnostics door and the licence door — is
/// still exactly one tap from here and still writes exactly the same provider.
/// What changed is that they are now *screens* rather than cards stacked on one
/// scroll, which is what `design/mobile-preview/screens-settings.js` specifies.
///
/// The two rules the previous screen was built to keep are unchanged and are
/// now enforced one level down:
///
///   * **One source of truth per setting.** The appearance screen reads and
///     writes `themeControllerProvider`, the same object the header toggle
///     writes. Moving the control onto its own screen did not give it a copy.
///   * **No row that controls nothing.** Every row here opens a registered
///     route; `test/features/reachability_test.dart` taps all of them.
///
/// ## Every row reports what it is SET TO
///
/// `Appearance · Light, dark or follow your device` names the choices and not
/// the choice; `Reminders · A gentle nudge, on your terms` is a sentence about
/// the feature. Nine rows of that is a menu you have to open to read. So the
/// five rows that HAVE a current value print it — `System · Indigo`, `Off`,
/// `On · Wi-Fi only` — and the four that are doors keep their sentence.
///
/// **A value still loading is null, and null falls back to the sentence.**
/// Printing a default as though it were the setting is the stale-as-current lie
/// at its smallest scale, and this screen is exactly where an owner comes to
/// check.
///
/// ## One row the prototype does not have
///
/// **Instruments → `/diagnostics`.** The prototype has no diagnostics screen to
/// draw a row for, and this product does: `diagnostics_screen.dart` argues that
/// the baselines and the strap's raw streams belong somewhere the owner goes
/// when something looks wrong, and that argument *"is only sound while there is
/// a door"*. Settings is the only door. It is added inside the prototype's own
/// `Your connected device` section, because that is what it is about — the
/// section ORDER is the prototype's, and one row is added to a section rather
/// than a section invented for it.
