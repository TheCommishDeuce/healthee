/// rather than printed.
///
/// Its sources sit behind the ⓘ at the foot of the bubble, not under the
/// sentence — the owner asked three times for citation chips off the surfaces
/// that carry prose, and a reply that cited four notes was four stamps of chrome
/// under every answer. An answer that cites nothing draws no ⓘ at all.
///
/// Two pieces of response metadata ride in that sheet rather than beside it:
///
///   * **`grade_floor`** — the weakest evidence grade among the notes cited. It is
///     the answer's own statement of how firm it is, and `INTELLIGENCE §3` makes
///     it part of the response rather than a nicety. `null` means nothing
///     gradeable was cited, which is not a weak grade and is not rendered as one.
///   * **`validated: false`** — the blocking validator rejected the model's answer
///     and the honest fallback shipped. That is the product working, and it is
///     also not the answer the owner asked for, so it says both.
///
/// A [CoachTrouble] wears the same bubble. It is not an error banner: a failure
/// that looked different from the rest of the thread would read as the app
/// breaking rather than as an answer about the question that was asked.
