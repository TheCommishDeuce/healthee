/// It replaced `LoadingState(label: 'Asking your coach')`: one 16 px spinner and
/// four words, held for a wait that was **measured at 80–304 seconds** on the
/// owner's own broad question. A spinner is a fine way to say "a moment"; held
/// for four minutes it says "this has hung", and the owner's own report was that
/// the coach "takes insane amount of time" — which was true, and the screen was
/// doing nothing to make the time legible.
///
/// ## The stage shown is the wire's, never invented
///
/// `POST /api/coach/stream` names its own progress (`data/coach/coach_stream_
/// event.dart`'s `CoachStage`), so this widget can say what the server is
/// actually doing instead of a description of the whole operation. The rule
/// this file was built to keep is unchanged, only its instrument improved: a
/// stepper advancing on a TIMER would be inventing server state and showing it
/// as fact, which is the exact move the honesty contract forbids. [progress]
/// is null until the first `stage` event lands — before that, and against an
/// older server that falls back to the non-streaming call, this widget says
/// exactly what it always said, because that is still all it knows.
///
/// So what is shown is only what is actually known:
///
/// * the elapsed time, counted here and true by construction;
/// * [progress]'s own stage, worded by [coachStageLabel] — or, before the
///   first one arrives, the same whole-operation sentence this screen showed
///   before streaming existed;
/// * after [_longAfter], a second sentence saying the wait is longer than usual
///   and that broad questions take more rounds. That is a statement about the
///   distribution, not about this request, and it is the honest way to say
///   "still working" without pretending to know why.
///
/// ## "You can leave this screen"
///
/// The one piece of genuinely useful news, and it is checked rather than hoped:
/// `CoachController` is `@Riverpod(keepAlive: true)`, so the request is owned by
/// the provider and not by this widget. Popping the route does not cancel it and
/// the answer is in the thread on return. Told to the owner because a four-minute
/// wait they are required to sit through is a different product from one they can
/// walk away from.
