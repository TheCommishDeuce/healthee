/// **This is the v02 prototype's screen, in the prototype's order.**
/// `design/mobile-preview/screens-overview.js::H.screens.activity`, read top to
/// bottom:
///
/// ```text
///   header                    date · Activity · avatar
///   activity analysis         this app's own — the prototype has no surface
///   fitness with its source   VO₂max, its rail, its instrument
///   fitness → age · recovery  two entry cards (F3)
///   today’s movement          steps, the week of them, energy, active minutes
///   your week, by intensity   moderate-equivalent minutes and their parts
///   training load             today's TRIMP against the habit behind it
///   the sessions behind it    the recorded workouts
///   footer
/// ```
///
/// **The prototype's two bridge sentences are entry cards now** (F3,
/// `DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`). The owner called the sentences "stupid text between
/// the cards" and the two destinations — the age model and recovery — "very
/// cool"; a card makes them visible instead of hiding a link at the end of
/// prose.
///
/// ## What survived the redesign, and what did not
///
/// The **data wiring** survived whole. Every figure is still a [Reading], every
/// block is still gated on what the payload carried, and a refusal still renders
/// as a refusal with the server's own reason.
///
/// The six pre-v02 cards did not. `steps_card`, `workouts_card`, `mvpa_card`,
/// `cardio_load_card`, `vo2max_card` and `biological_age_card` were this
/// screen's only callers, and four of them still drew a `CitationRow` on their
/// face — the surface the owner asked us to move behind the ⓘ. Their sources are
/// not dropped: each v02 panel carries them in `MetricDetail`, which is what
/// makes the ⓘ draw at all.
///
/// **Biological age is not on this screen any more.** The prototype puts it in
/// Today's hero and links to an age-detail screen from here; Today's hero is
/// built, so the number is reachable and is drawn once. Two screens, one of
/// which exists to restate the other's headline number, is how two numbers start
/// disagreeing.
///
/// ## The one section the prototype has no equivalent for
///
/// `InsightCard(scope: 'activity')` is a grounded, server-written reading of
/// this screen's own numbers. The prototype has no surface for it, and Today
/// keeps `ActionsSection` and `InsightsSection` for exactly the same reason:
/// deleting a reachable server surface because the design mock-up has no box for
/// it is a feature removal wearing a redesign's clothes. It sits last, after the
/// bridge, and renders nothing when the server has nothing.
