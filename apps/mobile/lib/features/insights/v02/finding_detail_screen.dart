/// One finding, opened from the Insights relationship card.
///
/// The prototype's `H.screens.insight`. Composition only — every sentence and
/// every number on it is built in `finding_detail_parts.dart`.
///
/// ## How the screen finds its finding
///
/// **The server sends findings with no id.** `read/findings.py::_shape` emits
/// `kind`, `metric_a`, `metric_b`, `event_kind`, `lag_days` and the statistics;
/// there is no stable key to route on. So the route carries the pair itself, and
/// the finding travels alongside it in `extra`:
///
///   * a tap from the card passes the object — the screen draws immediately, and
///     what it draws is exactly what the card was showing;
///   * a cold start on the URL (a restored stack, a deep link) has no `extra`,
///     so the screen re-resolves the pair against today's findings.
///
/// If neither yields a finding the screen says so and offers the way back. It
/// does **not** synthesise one from the route: the path segment holds two metric
/// names and a lag, which is enough to name a pattern and nowhere near enough to
/// restate its strength. A screen that inferred the rest would be inventing the
/// only numbers it exists to show.
