/// Insights — where the owner's own history is read back to them.
///
/// Composition only: the frame, the two data sources and the reveal registry are
/// `shared/instrument_screen.dart`'s, and `insights_sections.dart` decides what
/// this screen shows and in what order. This file is the wiring — the six places
/// the screen can reach — and nothing else.
///
/// This is `docs/APP_DESIGN.md` §2's fourth tab and legacy's (Today · Sleep ·
/// Activity · **Insights** · Actions). It holds the two things that are about
/// the *history* rather than about today: how each tracked metric has been
/// moving, and the correlations the analytics layer found in this one person's
/// data.
///
/// The findings used to be on a tab called Coach. That was wrong twice over —
/// the coach is not a tab in legacy (it is a button on Today, and it is one
/// again), and the findings are not the coach: they are the evidence a coach
/// question would be answered *from*. The prototype says the same thing in its
/// own order, by ending this screen on `A useful question comes next`.
