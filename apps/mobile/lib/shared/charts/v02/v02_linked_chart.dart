/// **The showpiece.** Two signals, stacked, sharing one hour cursor and nothing
/// else.
///
/// Heart rate and stress across a day is the case it was built for: two things
/// the owner can watch move together, on two axes that are each labelled in
/// their own units, with one cursor that puts both readings side by side in the
/// same instant.
///
/// ## The caveat is part of the chart, not decoration on it
///
/// The prototype's own caption is the honest framing and it ships as the
/// widget's default: *"A coinciding change is context, not proof that one signal
/// caused the other."* Two traces drawn one above the other with a shared cursor
/// is a machine for producing causal readings — that is exactly what makes the
/// chart useful, and exactly what makes it dangerous. So the sentence belongs to
/// the chart rather than to whichever card happens to embed it, because a caveat
/// a call site can forget is a caveat that will be forgotten.
///
/// ## Both panes or neither
///
/// If either signal is too short to draw, the whole chart withholds and keeps
/// its slot. A "linked" chart with one live pane is not a weaker version of this
/// chart — it is a different chart, drawn under a title promising a comparison
/// the reader cannot make.
///
/// **No screen draws this since R3** (`docs/REDUNDANCY_INVENTORY.md`): Activity's
/// heart rate & stress panel was its last caller, removed because Today now
/// draws both series in their own cards. Kept, with its tests, because the
/// chart primitives around it were built for it and the owner may want the
/// side-by-side comparison back.
