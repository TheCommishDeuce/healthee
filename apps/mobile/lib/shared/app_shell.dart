/// The app frame: one `Scaffold`, one bar, retained tab branches and one back rule.
///
/// This is the widget half of `StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack` (wired in
/// `core/router.dart`). The shell owns the only [AppTabBar] in the app and the
/// only `Scaffold` that has one; `navigationShell` is an `IndexedStack` of one
/// `Navigator` per tab, each keeping its own widget tree, scroll offsets and
/// route stack alive while the others are shown.
///
/// ## What the indexed stack buys, measured
///
/// Before this, each tab was a plain `GoRoute` and a tab switch built a new page:
/// scrolling Today two screenfuls, tapping Sleep and tapping Today put Today back
/// at the top. Three things went with the scroll offset, and only one of them was
/// visible:
///
///   * every `RevealOnce` chart animated again — CLAUDE.md's rule is that charts
///     must not replay, and the widget was holding it correctly while the
///     navigation layer discarded the registry it holds it in;
///   * provider reads re-ran, so a tab switch could re-hit the network;
///   * there was no per-tab back stack, so Android back did not do what a tab bar
///     implies.
///
/// ## The back rule, and why it ends where it does
///
/// Android back is answered here, in three steps, in this order:
///
/// ```text
///   1. the current tab's own Navigator can pop   →  pop it
///   2. otherwise, not on Today                   →  go to Today
///   3. otherwise (Today, nothing to pop)         →  leave the app
/// ```
///
/// Step 1 is why this reads the **branch navigators** rather than keeping a
/// history list: the branch `Navigator` already holds the truth about what a tab
/// has pushed, and a parallel list of visited tabs would be a second copy of the
/// navigation state, free to disagree with the first and impossible to keep right
/// through a deep link. `StatefulShellBranch.navigatorKey` is public API for
/// exactly this.
///
/// Step 2 is the bug this rule exists to fix: back from Sleep used to quit the
/// app. A bottom bar implies a home, and back means "up" long before it means
/// "out".
///
/// **Step 3 is a deliberate choice and the alternatives were worse.** Back on
/// Today with an empty stack exits, because:
///
///   * it is what every other tabbed Android app does, and back is the one
///     gesture whose meaning the owner brings with them rather than learns here;
///   * *"press back again to exit"* is a toast that trains people to press back
///     twice for the rest of the app's life to save an accident that costs
///     nothing — nothing is unsaved. The store is on disk, the sync controller is
///     `keepAlive` and survives the screen, and a sync in flight is not cancelled
///     by the frame being disposed;
///   * refusing to exit at all leaves the owner pressing a system button that
///     does nothing, which is the same defect as the dead Actions tab in a
///     different place.
///
/// The rule is `PopScope(canPop: false)` plus an explicit `SystemNavigator.pop()`
/// on the third branch rather than a `canPop` that flickers between true and
/// false: `canPop` is read by the framework at times we do not control, and a
/// value computed from the branch stacks would have to be recomputed on every
/// push anywhere in the app.
///
/// ## The bar is in the `bottomNavigationBar` slot, not over the content
///
/// So the body is **laid out above** the bar rather than under it, which is what
/// keeps the last card off it; the bar's own `SafeArea` then adds the gesture
/// inset beneath the icons. A bar floating over the scroll would need every list
/// to know its height, which is one more number to get wrong per screen.
///
/// ## What is deliberately OUTSIDE the shell
///
/// Pairing, server sign-in, `/settings` and `/diagnostics` are full-screen routes
/// with no tab bar. Pairing and sign-in are setup flows the app redirects into — a
/// bar offering four destinations to somebody who has not paired a strap offers
/// four empty screens. Settings and diagnostics are about the app rather than
/// about a day, and lighting a tab on either (diagnostics used to light Today)
/// says the owner is somewhere they are not.
