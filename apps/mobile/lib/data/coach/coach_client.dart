/// The two calls the coach surface makes, and the named failures they can have.
///
/// `POST /api/coach` costs one of the owner's twenty included questions per
/// rolling thirty days (`PRICING.md` §0), and `GET /api/entitlement` is how many
/// are left. They are in one file because they are one transaction from the
/// owner's point of view: the meter is read before the question is asked and again
/// after it is answered, and a surface that could do one without the other is the
/// silent spend this feature is not allowed to have.
///
/// ## Why the meter is re-read rather than decremented
///
/// The server refunds the question on a refusal, on an unvalidated answer, and on
/// a transport failure (`routers/coach.py`). A client that subtracted one locally
/// would be wrong in all three cases and would be wrong in the *flattering*
/// direction — showing fewer questions than the owner has. Re-reading is one cheap
/// ungated call and it is the number the gate itself will enforce.
///
/// ## 402 is an answer, not a crash
///
/// The gate refuses with `402` and a body carrying `limit`, `used`, `resets_at`
/// and `retry_after_s`. That is the same information `/api/entitlement.included`
/// carries, so it is parsed into the same [CoachRefusal] shape rather than shown
/// as an HTTP status — a `DioException` type is never rendered to anybody
/// (`data/api/signin_failure.dart` sets the precedent).
