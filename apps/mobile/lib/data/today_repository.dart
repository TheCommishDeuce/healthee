/// Fetches, caches and parses `GET /api/today` — the whole boundary, end to end.
///
/// The pipeline this file completes: dio (one client, authenticated) → JSON →
/// the local tier → [TodaySnapshot.fromJson] → typed model with [Reading] fields
/// → a provider a screen watches. Nothing above this line sees a
/// `Map<String, Object?>` again, which is Standards §3's "typed models at the
/// data boundary" in one function.
///
/// ## The cache stores BYTES, and re-parses them on the way out
///
/// `local_store.dart` argues this at length and it is worth repeating where it
/// is used: the row holds the response body verbatim, and the same
/// `fromJson` the network path uses turns it back into a model. A cache that
/// shredded the payload into columns would be a second definition of every
/// metric on this screen, and a cache that parsed differently from the network
/// could show a number the server never sent.
///
/// ## Falling back is not the same as succeeding
///
/// [TodayRepository.load] tries the network and falls back to the cache, and the
/// difference is carried out in [TodayView.fromCache] rather than hidden. A
/// silent fallback would let a phone that has been offline for three days draw a
/// full screen of confident numbers about a Tuesday.
///
/// When the network fails AND there is nothing cached, the error propagates:
/// Riverpod turns it into `AsyncError` for [AsyncView] to render with a retry.
/// Returning an empty [TodaySnapshot] instead would be the banned pattern —
/// "returning empty-string/empty-map to mean 'something failed'" (Standards §1)
/// — and would show a page of withheld cards implying the owner's data is
/// missing when it is merely unreached.
///
/// ## The day travels with the request, and with the fallback
///
/// `/api/today` takes an optional `day=YYYY-MM-DD` and answers for it
/// (`docs/AS_OF_DAY.md`), so [TodayRepository.load] passes the day being read and
/// the derived half stops being a current-day-only answer.
///
/// The cache follows the same rule and it is the sharper half. A payload is
/// filed under the day it describes, and a past-day request that cannot reach the
/// server falls back to **that day's row or to nothing** — never to the newest
/// one. `readLatest` for a past day would put today's judgements on screen under
/// an older date, which is precisely the stale-as-current failure the server-side
/// work exists to prevent; reaching it through the cache instead of through the
/// endpoint would be the same lie by a longer route.
