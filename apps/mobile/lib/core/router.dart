/// The router. Five tabs, the setup surfaces, and settings outside the shell.
///
/// The paths themselves are `core/routes.dart` — split out at the 400-line gate
/// and re-exported below, so `import 'core/router.dart'` still names them.
///
/// `docs/APP_DESIGN.md` §2 fixes the information architecture — five tabs (Today ·
/// Sleep · Activity · Insights · Actions), a Coach FAB on Today, and the owner's
/// own surfaces off the Today avatar rather than as a sixth tab. All five tabs and
/// the avatar's destination now exist; `core/tabs.dart` records what changed and
/// why.
///
/// go_router rather than `Navigator` calls: deep links (a notification opening one
/// night's sleep detail) and typed paths are both things the app will need, and
/// retrofitting a router after screens exist means touching every screen.
///
/// ## The five tabs are BRANCHES, not sibling pages
///
/// They were plain sibling `GoRoute`s, which meant every tab switch built a new
/// page and threw the old one away — scroll offset, chart reveals and provider
/// reads with it. `shared/app_shell.dart` records the measurement. They are now
/// the branches of a `StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack`, each with its own
/// `Navigator`, all kept alive — which is also what gives the Android back button
/// a per-tab stack to pop (the shell owns that rule).
///
/// ## `go` REPLACES. Every out-of-shell destination is pushed.
///
/// This shipped wrong once and the bug is worth stating in full, because the
/// mistake reads as correct: `context.go` replaces the location rather than
/// stacking on it, so a `go` into Settings left **nothing underneath**. The
/// shell's back rule then did exactly what it says — an empty branch stack, not
/// on Today, so leave — and the owner was dropped onto the Android home screen
/// from a screen they had tapped into two seconds earlier. Every out-of-shell
/// route had it, so Settings → Diagnostics → back left the app too.
///
/// The rule, and it is a rule rather than a case-by-case judgement:
///
/// | navigation | verb | why |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | tab → tab (`app_tab_bar.dart`) | `go` | a bar switches between siblings; stacking them would make back walk a history of tabs |
/// | Today → settings · sign-in | `push` | a destination the owner came from somewhere and expects to return to |
/// | settings → diagnostics · sign-in · pairing | `push` | back lands on Settings, which is what made it findable |
/// | the redirect below | replace | there is nothing to return to |
///
/// **`push` is also what draws the back arrow.** A `go`-ed screen with an
/// `AppBar` has no leading control, so those screens offered no way back at all
/// — not even a wrong one. The gesture and the affordance were missing together,
/// which is why nothing on screen looked broken.
///
/// [leaveSetup] handles the one place the two columns meet: a setup flow that
/// may be pushed *or* redirected into.
