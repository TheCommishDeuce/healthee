/// Semantic colour roles, reachable from any widget as `context.colors`.
///
/// Feature code names a ROLE (`colors.ink3`, `colors.unf`) and never a value.
/// That is what makes both themes real: a widget written against roles is correct
/// in dark mode by construction; one written against hex is a bug nobody sees
/// until they toggle.
///
/// A `ThemeExtension` rather than top-level constants precisely so it varies with
/// the theme — and rather than Flutter's `ColorScheme`, which has no room for
/// "the fill of a number-shaped absence" and would only let us hide it in
/// `tertiaryContainer` under a name that lies.
///
/// ## Three naming decisions, because each replaced something
///
/// **[hole] is a FILL, not a hue.** A withheld value is drawn as a dashed [line]
/// border around a value-shaped box filled with [hole], at the size and position
/// the number would have had. Colour is rationed to judgement, so tinting a
/// refusal would make "we are declining to tell you" look like a verdict about
/// the owner's body. It is the opposite of one.
///
/// **[unf] is not a `warn`.** `unf` says *this reading is below your normal* — a
/// claim about the owner. A withhold says *we are not going to tell you* — a
/// claim about us. Colouring a refusal `unf` asserts the thing it declines.
///
/// **[alert] is the illness flag alone.** A failed network call is not a fact
/// about the owner's health, so it gets no health colour. `ColorScheme.error` is
/// still wired to [alert] because Material's own widgets need a red;
/// app-authored failure states do not use it.
