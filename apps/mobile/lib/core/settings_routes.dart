/// is a real one rather than a convenience: that file's one reason to change is
/// **the app's shape** — the tab shell, the redirect, the back rule — and this
/// one's is **which supporting screens exist**. The v02 redesign added seven of
/// them in one change and would have pushed the router past the gate again.

/// `leaveSetup` stays in `router.dart` because it is the back rule, which is
/// that file's subject; this list calls it.

/// **One definition, two callers.** [buildRouter] splices this into the app's
/// route list, and `test/features/_settings_harness.dart` mounts the same list
/// so a suite asking *"does this row land where it says"* is asking about the
/// routes the app actually ships. A second list in the test would answer that
/// question about the test.
///
/// The sub-screens are registered **flat** rather than as `routes:` children of
/// `/settings`. A nested route would put the index underneath every one of
/// them in the stack, and these are reached from three places — the index, the
/// device screen and the background screen — so what is underneath is whatever
/// pushed them, which is what `push` already means.
