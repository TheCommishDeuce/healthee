/// The prototype's header carries a date CONTROL, not a date label, and the
/// selection follows the reader between screens. This suite holds the control's
/// behaviour and the one thing it must never be allowed to cause.
///
/// ## What the control must never be allowed to cause
///
/// A date control creates a way to have one day's numbers on screen with another
/// day's date above them, which is **stale-as-current**: the failure `LastKnown`
/// exists for, the one `vo2max_tier.py`'s freshness horizon exists for, and the
/// one this repo has already swept three times.
///
/// The answer used to be a refusal — `/api/today` took no day, so the screen drew
/// nothing derived on a past one. The endpoint now takes `day=YYYY-MM-DD` and
/// answers from the rows filed under it (`docs/AS_OF_DAY.md`), so the refusal is
/// gone and the guard moved: the screen draws the payload only when the payload's
/// own `as_of` day is the day being read. That closes the same failure at its
/// remaining entry point — the frame between the tap and the response.
///
/// Both are tested against the section list directly rather than through a
/// scroll, because what is being asserted is what the screen DECIDED — a rendered
/// viewport would pass while the hero sat one scroll below it.
