/// Every door OUT of the tab shell, and the way back in through it.
///
/// `back_navigation_test.dart` covers the rule inside the shell — pop a route
/// pushed in a branch, non-Today → Today, Today → exit. That rule was right and
/// shipped broken anyway, because everything it governs lives *inside* the shell
/// and every screen the avatar opens lives outside it.
///
/// **`context.go` REPLACES the location.** A `go` into Settings left nothing
/// beneath it, so the shell's rule found an empty branch stack, correctly
/// concluded "not on Today", and left the app — from a screen the owner had
/// tapped into two seconds earlier. Settings → Diagnostics → back left the app
/// too. Found on a device; this suite is the half that was missing.
///
/// The other half of the same defect is that a `go`-ed screen with an `AppBar`
/// has no leading control, so these screens offered no way back **at all** —
/// not a wrong one, none. The gesture and the affordance went missing together,
/// which is why nothing on screen looked broken.
///
/// `test/mutations.sh` flips each `push` back to `go` and requires this file to
/// go red. That check is what was not there when it shipped.
///
/// ## The `parents` back-map, and the screens that had no door at all
///
/// The last group is the same defect one level in. `DetailPage` drew its back
/// control only when `Navigator.canPop()` was true, so a detail screen reached
/// with an EMPTY stack — a deep link, a notification, a restored process, or the
/// `go` this file's own title records — had no way off it. The fix is the
/// prototype's own (`app.js:8`, `core/parent_tabs.dart`): pop when there is a
/// stack, and otherwise land on the tab the screen belongs under.
