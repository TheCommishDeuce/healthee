/// **A withheld field renders as withheld, with its reason, on every panel.**
///
/// The failure this suite exists to catch is a quiet one: a field the server
/// refused, rendered as a blank or a zero. A zero is a measurement — it says the
/// owner slept nothing, weighed nothing, breathed nothing — and a blank says
/// nothing at all. `Reading` makes the refusal a type, and this suite is the
/// proof that every Sleep panel still renders that type as words the owner can
/// act on.
///
/// Each case blanks a field on the committed contract snapshot and asserts the
/// server's own sentence reaches the screen. Blanking is the one thing a fixture
/// read from a snapshot cannot do on its own, which is what `sleepPageWithout`
/// is for — and it asserts the field is really on the wire first, so a rename
/// fails the suite instead of quietly making every case vacuous.
