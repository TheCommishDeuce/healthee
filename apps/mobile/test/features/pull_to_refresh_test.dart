/// Pull-to-refresh is the manual sync, and it takes the un-debounced path.
///
/// This is what let the permanent "Sync now" button go. `sync_controller.dart`
/// keeps two entry points on purpose:
///
/// ```text
///   autoSyncNow()  debounced   a heuristic, run on a foreground transition
///   syncNow()      NEVER       what the owner asked for, right now
/// ```
///
/// and its own docstring says why the distinction is load-bearing: *"an explicit
/// request is not a heuristic, and a heuristic that could be triggered by asking
/// would make the button feel broken exactly when someone reached for it."*
/// Pulling down is asking. If the gesture were wired to [autoSyncNow] it would
/// silently do nothing inside the debounce window, which is the same broken
/// feeling with no button to blame.
///
/// The assertion is on WHICH METHOD RAN, not on whether data changed: a test that
/// checked for new rows would pass with either entry point on the first pull of a
/// cold app, and fail for reasons about the gate on the second.
