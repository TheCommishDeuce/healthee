/// A past day never wears ANOTHER day's judgements — on any of the fourteen screens.
///
/// `date_control_test.dart` holds this rule for Today, where it was first built.
/// The day follows the reader onto thirteen more screens, and the rule has to
/// hold on every one of them or the feature is a way to put one day's recovery,
/// MVPA, VO₂max, correlations and suggestions under another day's date. That is
/// stale-as-current, which this repo has swept three times.
///
/// **What the rule means changed when the server learned to answer for a day.**
/// Today and Activity read `/api/today`, which now takes `day=YYYY-MM-DD`
/// (`docs/AS_OF_DAY.md`), so their figures ARE that day's and are drawn: the
/// guard there is that the payload must answer for the day being read, not that
/// nothing derived may appear. The screens below that still refuse outright are
/// the ones whose content is LLM-authored or windowed on the current day, and
/// each says which in its own group.
///
/// Asked of the section builders rather than of a rendered scroll wherever
/// possible: what is being asserted is what the screen DECIDED, and a viewport
/// would pass while the offending card sat one scroll below it.
///
/// The other half — that a past day still draws everything it CAN — is asserted
/// beside each refusal, because a screen that answered "no" to everything would
/// satisfy the honesty rule and be useless.
