/// The editorial head of Today: legacy's greeting header, and the tab bar.
///
/// The header is v02's `H.header('Today', …)` — the date, the screen's name,
/// and the avatar with its sync ring — plus the `.device-strip` under it. The
/// tests here hold the things about them that are claims rather than layout:
/// the date table has no off-by-one, the strap's charge appears only when one
/// has been read, and **no cheerful phrase sits beside a safety sentence**.
///
/// That last one is why the header says `Today` and nothing else. The pre-v02
/// header opened with a two-line greeting and the obvious next step was to
/// derive a phrase from `recovery_score.band`. The contract snapshot is exactly
/// the case that makes it a bug: `band: "high"` beside guidance that begins
/// "An illness signal is active". v02 removes the salutation outright, which
/// settles it — but the assertion stays, because the band is still on the wire.
