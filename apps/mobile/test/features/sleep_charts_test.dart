/// The Sleep tab's charts PAINT, at the size the panels really lay them out at.

/// Two charts on this screen once shipped at zero height because a suite only

/// canvas at the laid-out size**. `findsOneWidget` is never the claim.
///
/// It also holds the two rules a stage chart can quietly break:
///
///   * **stages stay distinguishable** — the four hues are all painted, and they
///     come from `InstrumentHues.sleepStage`, the app's one stage mapping;
///   * **NO INTERPOLATION DRAWS A VALUE OUTSIDE THE INPUT RANGE** — the timing
///     chart's curve is monotone for exactly this reason, and a Catmull-Rom
///     regression would draw a bedtime earlier than any night measured.
