/// What reaches the SURFACE of the two rebuilt screens — and what must not.
///
/// Three claims, each of which a "does the screen render" test passes without
/// noticing:
///
///   * **No raw identifier.** `gps_graded`, `steps_total`, `mvpa_min` and
///     `hrv_sleep_avg` are wire ids. On a health screen they are log lines where
///     a name belongs, and `shared/format/metric_names.dart` exists to turn them
///     into words. The scan is over every `Text` the screen laid out, so an id
///     that leaks through a new panel fails here rather than looking fine.
///   * **No `[` citation marker.** The defect `grounded_surfaces_test.dart` was
///     written for — `…moderate movement [recovery_readiness]` — reaching a card
///     verbatim. That file drives Today's model prose; this one drives the two
///     screens it never sees.
///   * **The charts paint at the size they were really laid out to.** Two charts
///     have already shipped at zero height in this repo because a test only
///     checked that the widget existed. Every assertion below replays the
///     recorded canvas at the layout's own size.
