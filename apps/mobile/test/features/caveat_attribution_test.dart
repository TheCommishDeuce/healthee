/// **A caveat is attached to a number, or it is a claim about the wrong one.**
///
/// Two owner reports of 2026-08-06, one screen apart, and they are the same
/// defect seen from two sides:
///
///   * *"what are those * symbol in card"* — `CaveatMark` drew a bare asterisk
///     and nothing on the screen said what it meant. The file it lived in states
///     in its own docstring that a caveated value discloses **in words**; an
///     asterisk is not words, and only a reader who had opened that file could
///     have known.
///   * *"the caveat is sitting and its difficutlt to understand which caveat is
///     that pointing to"* — `ReadingView` drew the signpost as a SIBLING beneath
///     whatever its builder returned. On a screen of cards that put the sentence
///     in the **gutter**, closer to the card below it than to the one it
///     qualifies.
///
/// The second is the dangerous one. A disclosure attached to the wrong number is
/// not a weaker disclosure, it is a **misattributed** one: it can read as
/// qualifying a figure that is in fact unqualified, which is a new false claim
/// produced entirely by layout. `shared/states/caveat_scope.dart` carries the
/// fix; this file is the guard on it, and it is deliberately geometric rather
/// than structural — "the carrier is mounted" was already true while the owner
/// was looking at the bug.
///
/// It runs on **every screen that draws a caveated reading**, because the fix is
/// per-carrier and the orphaning was per-call-site.
