/// What a tab switch costs — measured, because it used to cost everything.
///
/// The bar was five per-screen copies over four sibling `GoRoute`s, so every tab
/// switch built a new page and threw the old one away. Scrolling Today two
/// screenfuls, tapping Sleep and tapping Today put Today back at the top.
///
/// Two of the three things that went with the scroll offset are invisible, which
/// is why this file exists rather than a note in a docstring:
///
///   * **The reveal registry died with the screen.** `RevealOnce` holds "have I
///     been seen" in the SCREEN's `State` precisely so a `ListView.builder` can
///     destroy and rebuild the chart without replaying it — and the navigation
///     layer was destroying the screen. CLAUDE.md's rule was held perfectly
///     inside a screen and defeated between them.
///   * **Providers re-read**, so a tab switch could re-hit the network.
///
/// Both are downstream of one fact — does the screen's `State` survive a round
/// trip — so that is what is asserted, twice, from two directions: the scroll
/// position that only a live `Scrollable` can hold, and the identity of the
/// `RevealOnce` state objects, which is what decides whether a reveal is re-armed
/// at all.
///
/// The last two are about the bar as a surface rather than as navigation: the
/// content must be laid out ABOVE it, not under it, and the tab you are standing
/// on must be legible as such by SHAPE, not by brightness alone.
