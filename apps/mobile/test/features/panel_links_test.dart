/// The `Details` links, and where each one actually lands.
///
/// `docs/V02_CONNECTIVITY.md` section 2 is a walk of all 33 prototype screens.
/// Most of what it found missing was not a missing SCREEN — it was a panel whose
/// `Details` link was never wired, or was wired to a neighbour.
///
/// A link that lands on the wrong screen is the hard case for a test to catch,
/// because it looks exactly like a link that works: the control is there, the
/// tap does something, and a new screen appears. So this suite taps the control
/// and names the screen it expects, rather than asking whether a callback is
/// non-null.
///
/// Three suites divide this subject and the seam is the KIND of control:
/// `today_order_test.dart` owns which panels are drawn and in what order;
/// `v02_screen_links_test.dart` owns the doorways into the four screens that
/// were built last (a hero row, a bridge, a relationship card); and this file
/// owns the `Details` link on a panel head, the two bridges Today draws, the
/// device strip and the metric directory's closing rows.
