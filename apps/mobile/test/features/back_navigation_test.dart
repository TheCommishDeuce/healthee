/// What Android back does — all three branches of the rule, including the one
/// that leaves the app.
///
/// Back used to quit from any tab: the shell had no `PopScope`, so the system
/// pop went straight past five branch navigators to the engine. The rule is now
/// in `shared/app_shell.dart` and it is three steps, so this suite is three
/// groups plus a route pushed inside a tab, which is the case the first step
/// exists for and the one a history-list implementation would get wrong.
///
/// **The third outcome is asserted against the platform channel.** Leaving the
/// app is not something a widget test can see in the tree, so this watches
/// `SystemChannels.platform` for the `SystemNavigator.pop` the shell actually
/// sends. A boolean on the shell would have been easier to assert and would have
/// been asserting the flag rather than the behaviour.
///
/// ## What this file does NOT cover, and where that lives
///
/// Everything here is *inside* the shell. That is the whole of the rule and it
/// was still not the whole of the behaviour: every screen the avatar opens lives
/// outside the shell, was reached with `context.go`, and therefore had nothing
/// beneath it — so this rule fired and left the app. `out_of_shell_navigation_
/// test.dart` is that half, and it exists because this file passing was not
/// evidence that back worked.
