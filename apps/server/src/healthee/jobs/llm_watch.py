"""The alerting half: turn a dead AI layer into a message somebody actually receives.

## The incident this is the answer to

2026-08-01: the OpenRouter account hit its $200 ceiling. Every LLM call 402'd — coach,
insight cards, the whole nightly chain — for hours, while ``/healthz`` returned
``{"status":"ok","db":"ok"}``. It surfaced because an eval run happened to die. A pull
surface alone (``/readyz``) would not have fixed that: nobody was looking. Something had
to *push*.

The Telegram channel that already carries chain-step failures is that something, and it
is reused rather than duplicated — a second notifier would be a second thing to
configure, a second thing to leave unconfigured, and a second place for the
"notifications are broken" failure to hide. This module owns the POLICY (when is it
worth a message?) and ``core.notify`` stays the only sink.

## Two signals, because neither alone is enough

* ``insights.transport_health`` — what real traffic is doing, in THIS process. It is
  free and immediate, but it is per-process memory: an outage that so far has only hit
  the api container is invisible here.
* ``insights.credits`` — the account balance. It costs nothing (a free endpoint, no
  tokens) and it is a property of the ACCOUNT, so it sees an exhausted balance no matter
  which process the failing calls were in. It also authenticates with the same key, so a
  revoked key fails the probe and is reported.

Together: the balance probe usually fires FIRST (before zero, by design), and the
transport signal is the backstop for everything a balance cannot express — a dead key, a
provider outage, a network partition.

## Why a scheduler tick and not the request path

``send_telegram`` is a synchronous HTTP POST with a 10 s timeout. On a request path that
is latency somebody pays for, on an error path it is latency somebody pays for while
already having a bad time. The scheduler is a loop that already wakes on a timer and
already owns the Telegram health surface, so the alert costs nothing anybody is waiting
for. The api's contribution is ``/readyz``, which is a pull.

## Edge-triggered, with recovery — never level-triggered

An alert repeated every tick is an alert that gets muted, and a muted channel is worse
than no channel because it also swallows the chain-failure messages it shares. So each
condition alerts ONCE on the way in and ONCE on the way out. The state is in memory,
like ``scheduler._ATTEMPT_BUDGET``, and for the same reason: a container restart is a
legitimate reason to re-announce a still-broken world.

``degraded`` and ``unknown`` deliberately neither alert nor clear an alert. Alerting on
``degraded`` is alerting on the blip this design exists to ignore; *clearing* on it
would re-arm the alarm mid-outage and page again on the next failure.
