"""OpenRouter chat client (OpenAI-compatible API) — the ONE LLM transport.

OpenRouter exposes Anthropic / OpenAI / Google models behind a single
OpenAI-compatible endpoint; we point the ``openai`` SDK at its base URL. Every
LLM surface reaches this through the grounded-ask choke point (``grounded.py``),
never directly (standards §2: "LLM access only via the grounded-ask choke point").

The API key is read once from ``core.config`` and never logged (standards
§Errors: no secret ever reaches a log line). Neither is the MODEL ID: it is kept out of
git on purpose (ids resolve from ``DEFAULT_MODEL`` / ``COACH_MODEL``) and a log line that
prints it undoes that at runtime, so every diagnostic here names the TIER instead
(:func:`tier_of`). Tests inject a stub implementing the ``LLMClient`` protocol, so no
network call happens under pytest.

        (recs) so the model returns a parseable object, not fenced prose. Default
        ``None`` leaves the request unchanged (prose path is byte-identical).

        ``reasoning=False`` asks the provider NOT to spend thinking tokens on this call
        (OpenRouter's ``reasoning: {enabled: false}``; ``Settings.coach_reasoning`` says

        byte-identical to before the parameter existed. ``True`` is deliberately also

        thinking explicitly would change the request for models that never think.

        completion. The recording brackets the SDK call only: `_client()` raising for an
        unset key is a *configuration* fact, not a transport one, and counting it as a
        failed call would report the AI layer as broken on a box deliberately running
