"""The OpenRouter balance — the cheap version of never running out again.

``GET /api/v1/credits`` returns the account's ``total_credits`` and ``total_usage`` in
dollars. It is a plain read on a normal key: **it spends no tokens and costs nothing**,
which is what makes it safe to poll on a timer where a completion call would not be.
(``GET /api/v1/activity`` would give per-day spend, but it requires a *management* key
and 403s on a normal one — deliberately not built on.)

Two jobs, and both matter:

* **Warn before zero.** ``transport_health`` can only tell us the layer is dead once it
  is; this tells us it is nearly dead while there is still time to top up. That is the
  whole difference between an alert and a post-mortem.
* **Prove the key still works.** The probe authenticates with the same key every
  completion uses, so a revoked or mistyped key fails here too — and this runs in the
  scheduler, on a timer, regardless of which process the failing completions were in.
  ``transport_health`` is per-process memory; this reading is a property of the ACCOUNT
  and is therefore the same fact everywhere.

## The reading is CACHED, and an error is cached too

``/readyz`` is unauthenticated, so an uncached read here would let anyone drive outbound
requests at OpenRouter one-for-one with requests at us. The TTL bounds it to one call
per :data:`_TTL_S` per process no matter how hard the endpoint is hit.

Failures are cached on the same terms, which looks wrong for about a second and is not:
a cached *error* still reports "we do not know the balance", which is the honest answer
and the one the caller must act on. Retrying the broken endpoint on every request would
turn a provider outage into a request-rate amplifier without learning anything sooner.

## "Unknown" is never "fine"

A probe that failed returns :data:`ERROR` with the reason. It does not return a
plausible-looking zero, and it does not return the last good reading as though it were
current (the stale-as-current bug class this repo has now hit three times). Standards
§Errors: "no data" and "operation failed" are different states and must be
distinguishable by the caller — here they are ``unconfigured`` and ``error``.

## What is NOT carried

The error path records the HTTP status code and the exception TYPE, never the response
body and never the request headers. The key is a secret and the body is free text we do
not control; a status code is the whole diagnosis and cannot leak either.
