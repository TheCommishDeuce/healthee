"""Application settings — the ONE place environment variables are read.

There are TWO env templates, one per deployment context, and every var must be
present in the one(s) that need it — they are not copies of each other:
  * `infra/.env.example` — the compose/prod template (consumed by
    docker-compose.prod.yml, deploy.sh, backup/). Its Postgres host is the `db`
    service name, and it carries the deploy/backup vars the container never sees.
  * `apps/server/.env.example` — the local-dev template for `apps/server/.env`
    (Postgres on localhost; what the test suite and `scripts/model_eval.py` read).
Adding a setting below means adding it to BOTH unless it is genuinely
context-specific — a var that exists in only one silently defaults in the other,
which is how a blank model id reaches OpenRouter as a 400 in prod.

No other module in the codebase may touch `os.environ` — they call
`get_settings()` instead (standards §2: "config (pydantic-settings ONLY)").

The accessor is import-safe: nothing is constructed at import time, so importing
this module never fails even when required vars are unset. `get_settings()`
constructs (and caches) the singleton on first call, where a misconfiguration
fails loudly instead of silently defaulting.
