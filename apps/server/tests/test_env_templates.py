"""The env templates and the compose file must stay a complete inventory of `Settings`.

This is the cheap check that would have prevented #56. Every field on
`core.config.Settings` defaults to something constructible, so a var missing from the
file a deployer copies produces an API that **starts, reports `/healthz` green, and
runs a dead subsystem**. Nothing in the deploy can see that: the templates are prose,
compose is YAML, and `Settings` is Python, so the three drift apart silently and the
only detector was someone noticing a 400 in a log.

Three invariants, each catching a different half of the drift:

1. **`infra/.env.example` declares every field, uncommented.** It is the file an
   operator copies to `infra/.env`; a commented line there is a var they will not set.
2. **`apps/server/.env.example` declares every field**, commented allowed — it is the
   local-dev inventory, and a var like `API_HOST` is documented rather than required.
3. **The compose `api` service passes every field through.** `LLM_TIMEOUT_S` and
   `LLM_MAX_RETRIES` were in `infra/.env.example` and *not* in compose, so setting
   them in prod's `.env` did nothing at all — a template promising something the
   container never received, which is #56's exact shape one layer down.

Plus the reverse direction: a key in a template that `Settings` does not read is
either a typo (`DEFAULT_MODLE=`) or a var nobody consumes. Both are caught by pinning
the deploy-only names explicitly.
