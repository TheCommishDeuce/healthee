"""The LLM transport is time-bounded, and a timeout is REPORTED — never an empty card.

Two separate properties, because the bug had two halves:

1. **The limits reach the SDK.** `insights/client.py` passed no `timeout`/`max_retries`,
   so it silently inherited the SDK's `Timeout(read=600)` + `max_retries=2` — 3 × 600 s
   = 30 minutes of hang for ONE stuck call. Since 6.4c the scheduler is a
   single-threaded tick loop over `active_users()`, so that call blocks every later
   owner's chain for half an hour while the tick just waits. Asserting the numbers
   *in settings* would prove nothing; the test asserts what the SDK constructor is
   actually handed.
2. **A timeout surfaces.** The failure mode this codebase must never have is a broken
   transport that reads as "no data" — so the timeout is followed all the way out: it
   is not caught by the choke point, and it lands on the chain's supervisor as a
   reported `failed`.

No network: the SDK constructor is faked and the client stub raises.

None of this exercises the real transport's request shape, only `_client()`'s SDK
construction and a `LLMClient`-protocol stub that raises directly — so its premise
holds unchanged now that `OpenRouterClient.complete` streams: `llm_timeout_s` is
still exactly this per-read socket bound, just no longer the ONLY wall-clock bound
(`llm_deadline_s`, enforced in `client_stream.accumulate` and tested in
`test_client.py`, catches the failure this file's read timeout cannot: a socket kept
busy by keepalive bytes rather than gone silent).
