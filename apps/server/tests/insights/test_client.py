"""Transport unit tests — provider routing, the JSON output-format seam, the model id
stays unlogged, and the transport-health record.

No network: the OpenAI SDK object is replaced by a fake (`_client_fakes.py`, shared
with `test_client_streaming.py` and `test_coach_reasoning.py`) that records the kwargs
handed to ``chat.completions.create`` so we can assert ``response_format``/
``extra_body`` fields are (and are not) forwarded. The streamed-response assembly
itself (content deltas, tool calls, usage, the wall-clock deadline) is
`test_client_streaming.py` — split out purely to keep both files under the 400-line
gate.

The model-id concern is a standing owner constraint: **the model we run must not be
discoverable**. Keeping the ids out of git (they resolve from ``DEFAULT_MODEL`` /
``COACH_MODEL``) is undone by a runtime log line that prints them, which is what
``llm completion: model=…`` did on every single call. The tests below capture the log
records and assert the id is absent and the TIER is present, so an operator keeps the
diagnostic and nobody reading logs learns the id.
