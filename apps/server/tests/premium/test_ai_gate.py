"""The paywall at the HTTP edge — 402 for a free owner, over real requests (6.6a).

``MULTI_USER.md`` §12.7's invariant: *no AI response bytes ever leave the server for a
request whose owner is not premium.* Two halves are proved here and the third
(``jobs``) in ``test_chain_spend.py``:

* **every AI route refuses a free owner** — asserted by CALLING it, not by inspecting a
  decorator, because §12.7's first loophole is "direct API calls bypassing the locked
  UI" and a direct call is exactly what this makes. Since 2026-08-02 that is every AI
  route on the FIRST call: the free tier has no metered taste left (``test_premium_cap.py``
  owns the tables and the paid cap);
* **no AI route can be added without a gate** — ``test_every_mounted_route_is_gated_or_
  allowlisted`` walks the app's real dependency tree, so a new premium endpoint that
  takes ``CurrentUser`` fails the build rather than shipping open.

The second is the one that will still be working in a year. A hand-written list of
endpoints to probe can only cover what its author remembered; the route walk is driven
off the application object itself, the same way ``test_rls.py`` drives its completeness
check off the database catalog.
