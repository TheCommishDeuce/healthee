"""Shared test fixtures.

Unit tests set a minimal valid environment via the `env` fixture. Integration
tests depend on `db` (or `db_env`), which auto-skips when no TimescaleDB is
reachable — so `pytest` is green on a laptop with no database and exercises the
real DB in CI, where the service container sets POSTGRES_*.

## Every run gets its OWN database AND its own role (#119)

`app_role_pool` creates both, named after a per-process id. A private database alone
is **not** enough — the role is a cluster-level object, so two suites against one
PostgreSQL instance meet it even from different databases, and they corrupt each
other's run in ways that surface as failures in unrelated code. `tests/_isolation.py`
carries the full account; read it before changing anything session-scoped here.

## The whole suite runs as the LEAST-PRIVILEGE app role (6.5b-2)

`app_role_pool` below is autouse and session-scoped: it provisions the real
least-privilege role and points the **app pool** at it for the entire run, while
migrations / `TRUNCATE` / re-keying keep using the admin (`admin_connection`).

This is not tidiness — it is the acceptance bar for RLS. `POSTGRES_APP_*` is unset
in dev and CI, so without this fixture the app pool falls back to the admin
**superuser**, which `rolbypassrls` — every `0008` policy would be inert, every RLS
test would pass while protecting nothing, and any tenant query left on plain
`transaction()` would silently keep working here and return zero rows in prod. That
is the exact illusion 6.5b-1 exists to prevent, and it has bitten this project
before. `tests/db/test_rls.py::test_the_app_pool_is_never_privileged` asserts the
premise so a future env change cannot quietly undo it.
